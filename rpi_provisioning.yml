# Initial configuration for the Raspberry Pi that handles my home automation
#
# This playbook just ensures I have my user there, that it is a sudoer and
# that I can ssh with my own key, so I can use it for all other tasks
# in the main playbook (rpi.yml).
#
# Given it will likely be ran when an image was freshly baked, we also
# use the opportunity to bump all packages to latest and give it a good
# reboot, so it's ready to rumble
#
# To (re)start:
#   - Ensure your router is redirecting desired ports (80, 443, 8123) to
#     this RPi's network adaptor, and that it has a fixed IP
#   - Make your computer forget about old versions of that IP:
#     ssh-keygen -R IP
#   - Download Raspbian lite image and burn to SD with balenaEtecher (or dd)
#   - Before putting the SD card on RPi, mount it and:
#     - Create empty SSH file (touch /Volumes/boot/SSH)
#     - Create wpa_supplicant.conf
#       (model here: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/82923/100572)
#   - Unmount, put on RPi and boot it
#   - Wait a bit (it will cycle-boot at least once), then and run the command
#     below (password is raspberry):
#        ansible-playbook rpi_provisioning.yml -i hosts -k
